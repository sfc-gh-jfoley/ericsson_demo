# Feature Store Overview

Feature engineering, in which raw data is transformed into features that can be used to train machine learning models, is a vital part of building high-quality machine learning applications. A feature store lets you easily create, find, and employ features that work with your data.

The Snowflake Feature Store is designed to make creating, storing, and managing features for data science and machine learning workloads easier and more efficient. In this notebook, we will go through the steps to create and use Snowflake Feature Store.
