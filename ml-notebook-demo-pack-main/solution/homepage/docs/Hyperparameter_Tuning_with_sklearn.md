# Hyperparameter Tuning with sklearn
In this tutorial, we will walk you through an example workflow demonstrating how to use hyperparameter tuning with scikit-learn to select the optimal model for your machine learning problem. This comprehensive guide will help you understand the process of searching over a range of parameter combinations to find the best settings for your model using scikit-learn's GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV tools.

We will start by explaining the importance of hyperparameter tuning and how it can significantly improve your model's performance. You will learn how to set up GridSearchCV to exhaustively search over a specified parameter grid and RandomizedSearchCV to perform a randomized search over parameters, which can be more efficient for larger parameter spaces.

Additionally, we'll explore how to apply these techniques to not only fine-tune a single model but also to search across different models. This approach allows you to identify the best model-parameter combination for your specific machine learning task, ensuring that you achieve the highest possible performance.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a clear understanding of how to implement hyperparameter tuning in scikit-learn, enabling you to optimize your machine learning models effectively. To further enhance your learning experience, we encourage you to refer to the detailed scikit-learn documentation for more advanced techniques and best practices.
